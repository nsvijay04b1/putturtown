		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">FEW things remain 
		unchanged after 125 years. But Puttur seems to be caught in a time warp. 
		It has taken perhaps a decade for the small railway station to get a 
		roof over its head and for the lonely lodge in the town to get 
		competition. Neither the radical transformation in Chennai, 105 km away, 
		nor the slow modernisation in the temple town of Tirupati, 35 km away, 
		seem<img border="0" src="images/BONE%20SETTING.jpg" width="281" height="158" align="right"> 
		to have affected Puttur, located close to the Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu 
		border. Adding to the town's aura of timelessness is the Bone-setting 
		Hospital, in Easwarapuram two km from the railway station. </font>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">The Bone-setting Hospital 
		is the reason why Puttur is known outside Andhra Pradesh. Here, four 
		RMPs (registered medical practitioners) — as the doctors are called — 
		toil from dawn to dusk fixing hundreds of fractures, from hairline to 
		multiple, bone dislocations and arthritic bones to all those who come 
		from all over the country. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">Rudimentary 
		infrastructure </font></span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">To those used to the 
		modern medical techniques, the infrastructure is a rude shock. No x-ray 
		machines or scanners and no physiotherapist either. The hospital is a 
		medium-sized room with four beds. The doctors decide the complexity of 
		the fracture just by feeling it. The treatment is the same though the 
		intensity and duration vary depending on the extent of fracture. </font>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">Once the expert’s fingers 
		of the RMP identify the nature of fracture, the broken bones are 
		adjusted, often a painful procedure, and bound with a green herbal 
		paste. A cloth drenched in the herbal juice is tied around it. Bamboo 
		sticks (brought from the nearby forest with government permission) are 
		placed to ensure that the fractured bone does not move. The positioning 
		of the sticks varies from fracture to fracture. A cloth is finally 
		wrapped around the bamboo sticks.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="line-height: 115%"><font size="2">After 15 days the bandage 
		is removed, the fracture is reassessed and retied. This time, egg white 
		is mixed in the herbal juice. The herb reduces the swelling, loosens the 
		muscles and heals the bones, while egg albumin hardens the bone and 
		tightens the muscles. Repeated checks are made and the bandage is 
		replaced. </font></span></td>
